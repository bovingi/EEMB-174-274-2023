# Understanding Bayes' Rule

-   *My notes are italic!*

Goals for today:\
\* Learn the form of Bayes' Rule - *the math behind it!*\
\* Develop an understanding of how the components of Bayes' Rule affect the posterior probability\
\* Launch the shiny app in R and manipulate the input\
\* Write out your interpretation of the calculation

## Bayes' Rule

The general form of Bayes' Rule is shown here: $$
Pr(A|B) = \frac{Pr(B|A) Pr(A)}{Pr(B)}
$$

It gives as output the probability of event A given that we have observed event B *(could be new info that you gathered and what you know to be true)*.
It takes as input the total probabilities of A and B, and the opposite conditions probability, that B happens given an observation of A.
There are a lot of ways to think about how these pieces come together, and we explore that in the virtual whiteboard file for today.

-   *Coming up with this is a 'story'* *... a data story, and experiment story. We'll be putting that together.*

-   *Think venn diagram where circle A and circle B overlap, and you know how big B's circle is, but you want to know how much B shares with A.*

-   $$ Pr(A|B) = (A+B overlap)/((A+B overlap)+(B alone area)) $$\

Remember that a total probability can be found by summing the component conditional probabilities.
$$
Pr(B) = \sum_{i} Pr(B|p_i) Pr(p_i)
$$

### Applied to cold/covid symptoms

Here's a concrete example that we'll explore.
$$
Pr(\mathrm{covid}|\mathrm{symptoms})= \frac{Pr(\mathrm{symptoms}|\mathrm{covid}) Pr(\mathrm{covid})}{Pr(\mathrm{symptoms})}
$$

### Symptoms and Cause

$$
Pr(\mathrm{covid}|\mathrm{symptoms})= \frac{Pr(\mathrm{symptoms}|\mathrm{covid}) Pr(\mathrm{covid})}{Pr(\mathrm{symptoms})}  
$$ Which we can refine a bit by noting that their are two routes to have symptoms, you have covid or you have the flu.
(of course in reality there are more reasons to have symptoms, it could be allergies, or paranoia.... But for these calculations we assume only two routes.)

-   *Given you have a runny nose, what is the probability that you have Covid? (Make venn diagrams!) Our data: found 1 person with a runny nose, we know the prop. of people who runny nose when they get covid, and smae but for the flu. We want to know how likely it is that the person we sampled has covid.*

$$
Pr(\mathrm{covid}|\mathrm{symptoms})= \frac{Pr(\mathrm{symptoms}|\mathrm{covid}) Pr(\mathrm{covid})}{Pr(\mathrm{symptoms}|\mathrm{covid}) Pr(\mathrm{covid})+Pr(\mathrm{symptoms}|\mathrm{flu}) Pr(\mathrm{flu}) }
$$

If covid is rare, how likely is it that I have covid given that I have symptoms?
$$
Pr(\mathrm{covid}|\mathrm{symptoms})= \frac{  0.3 * 0.001 }{ 0.3*0.001 + 1*0.02 } = 0.015 
$$

-   *So here, prop you have a runny nose becuase you have covid = 0.0001, while probability you have a runny nose becuase you have the flu = 0.02.*

-   *If given probabilities (i.e. prob of runny nose given covid, or prob given flu), theres an intermediate calculation you'll have to do to figure out the denominator -- are the probabilities overlapping (i.e. can they both be true at once?) are they independent (i.e. they wont be true at once? e.g., you wouldn't have covid and have flu at the same time). This will decide what you add together in the denominator.*

If covid is common, how likely is it that I have covid given that I have symptoms?
$$
Pr(\mathrm{covid}|\mathrm{symptoms})= \frac{ 0.3 * 0.1}{0.3 * 0.1 + 1*0.02  } = 0.6
$$

-   *The info in the denominator might be non-intuitive, and will often be so*

### Breakout: explore the shiny app

Use this link to start your VM: <https://bit.ly/EEMB174>.\

Add a directory to store your work.
You will want to use the "export" function to save copies of your work on your own computer.

Navigate to the "In Class Material" folder and find today's date.
Click on the file "app.R".
Once it is loaded into the code tab you can run this shiny app by pressing the "Run App" button.

### Breakout Group Thought Question

Now consider a case where individuals can have both the flu and covid at the same time.
Draw the Venn diagram and write out sentence description of the answer that you get.

-   

### One final note:

Here we considered a situation where someone has flu-like symptoms, and wants to estimate the chances that the symptoms are due to covid.
We see that the frequency of both flu and covid in the population as a whole has a \`\`surprising'' effect on the cacluations.
This is very hard to accept based on most of the mathemtatical training you have recieved before.
But it is true.

We did this example thinking about symptoms, but it is exactly the same problem if we look at tests for the presence of covid.
Just replace "has sypmtoms" with "has a positive test result".
If people who do not have covid can possibly test positive, and people who do can possibly test negative, then we have the same exact equation, just with different names for the categories.

This was why, in the early covid days when antibody testing was being used to assess covid prevalence in the population, there was a strong cautionary warning that testing positive did not mean that you had covid, even when the chance of a false postive of the test was low.
When almost no one has had covid, almost every postive antibody test is due to a false positive!
