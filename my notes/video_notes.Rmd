**#Lecture 1:**

-   Golum: little clay creatures that are not real, but representations

-   Owls: draw 2 circles, then draw the rest!! Lol, thats not helpful.
    We want to learn all of the steps.

    -    To "draw the owl":

        -   1) Theoretical estimand,

            -   2) scientific causal models,

                -   3) Use 1 & 2 to build stat models

                    -   4) Simulate from 2 to validate step 3

                        -    5) Analyze real data.

                                We dont design the model based on our data, we do it at the end!

Other examples: Galileo and saturn, bayesian is flexible! focus on
scientific models, minimum fuss.

**#Lecture 2:**

What prop. of globe is covered in water? Use Bayesian inference! Random
sample, figure out all possible ways to get to those samples.

Things that can happen more ways are more plausible!
